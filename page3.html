    <p>Throughout my life, I have been driven by a desire to constantly 
        challenge myself and grow, which has led me to have a wide range 
        of work experiences. From the food industry to home childcare, I have 
        always been eager to learn new skills and take on new challenges. Currently, 
        I am working as a tour guide at Elon University, where I have the opportunity 
        to meet new people and show them around the campus that I love so much. During the 
        summers, I work as a head counselor at a summer camp for 3-5 year olds, which not 
        only allows me to spend time by the beach in my hometown of Rhode Island but also 
        gives me the joy of working with children. In 2021, I completed an internship at 
        a marketing and advertising firm, which was a valuable experience that helped me 
        shape my academic and professional goals. It was through this internship that I 
        realized my passion for Strategic Communications and Media Analytics, which ultimately 
        led me to pursue my degree at Elon.Aside from work and academics, I have a love for 
        playing field hockey and photography. I am actively seeking more involvement on campus 
        and enjoy attending cultural events. I also hold leadership roles as a Senator and Chief 
        of Staff on the student government and will be running for Student Body President next year.
        As I look towards the future, I am excited to see where my experiences will take me. Ideally, 
        I hope to live near the beach, where I can continue to pursue my passions and find new 
        opportunities to grow. I am excited for all the possibilities that lie ahead and am ready 
        to seize every opportunity that comes my way.
